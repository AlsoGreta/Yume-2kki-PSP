# Yume-2kki-PSP
Havent been able to find any form of offical proof of Yume Nikki or 2kki or really even proof of a working rpgmaker engine for psp. SO im going to release my cobbled together "working" port of it.

# How You Might Ask?
I was able to collect a few attemted but abandoned ports (most unworking) , fucked around and mixed the files together, somehow got atleast a stable port of rpgmaker 2000 out of it. I dont claim any of this code as my own work, just proof of getting it working.
### Known issues
- due to hardware limitations i had to use a really early build of yume 2kki, working on finding a better version that works
- i doubt this works on PSP 1000 models if at all. the 2000/3000 models with having 32mb more ram just work a little better, havent tested as i only have a PSP3000 so i dont know.
- you can only really go around like 2-3 dream realms before the game freaks out and crashes, i doubt theres a fix for this, just hardware limitations of the psp.
