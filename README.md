# Yume-2kki-PSP
Havent been able to find any form of offical proof of Yume Nikki or 2kki or really even proof of a working rpgmaker engine for psp. SO im going to release my cobbled together "working" port of it.
# How You Might Ask?
I was able to collect a few attemted but abandoned ports (most unworking) , fucked around and mixed the files together, somehow got atleast a stable port of rpgmaker 2000 out of it. I dont claim any of this code as my own work, just proof of getting it working.
