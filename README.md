# Yume-2kki-PSP
Havent been able to find any form of offical proof of Yume Nikki or 2kki or really even proof of a working rpgmaker engine. 
I was able to collect a few attemted but abandoned ports (most unworking) , fucked around and mixed the files together, somehow got atleast a stable port of rpgmaker 2000 out of it.
